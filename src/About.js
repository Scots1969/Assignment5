                              A few years ago, our founder’s young kids joined the neighborhood summer league swim team. Shortly
                              thereafter Mason’s wife volunteered him for the position of “Computer Guy.” Being an experienced
                              software engineer and a year-round and high school swimmer in his younger days, Mason thought, “Sure,
                              how hard can it be?” But he soon learned the answer was, “Very hard!” His team was using painfully
                              antiquated team management software — running on a team laptop that was passed around from one
                              volunteer to another. Determined to save time and frustration for himself and the other volunteers,
                              Mason developed an online system to manage his swim team. Over several seasons Mason added new
                              capabilities, the system evolved, and soon other teams in the area were asking if they could use it too.

                              During the spring and summer of 2010, Mason’s original system, created for just his team, was completely
                              rewritten and revamped into what would become Westminster Swim Club. Drawing from his experience
                              building software to support some of the highest traffic websites on the internet, Mason designed this
                              new system to leverage the scalability and security of cloud computing technology. In February 2011,
                              Westminster Swim Club opened its doors and made its first sales.
